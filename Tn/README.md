#_T_<sub>n</sub> scala

`Tn.scala` is a simple experimental tool for computing and listing triangular numbers.
Its capabilities are generating a list of subsequent triangular numbers by their ordinal positions or just putting the given 
exponential position of each **_T_<sub>n</sub>** in sequence to print some amazing triangular palindromes.

## Some Examples
```bash
$ ./Tn.scala -l
$ ./Tn.scala -n10
$ ./Tn.scala -p1r17n10g -e11g
$ ./Tn.scala -p12r2
$ ./Tn.scala -p12r3n100
$ ./Tn.scala -b13579 -n160010000 -e160013300 -p5
```
